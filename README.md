<b>Acolyte Hand PIC'd 32 Retraux Computer</b>

Using the PIC32MZ2048EFH144 microcontroller, this new computer runs at 150 MHz, with internal memory of 512KB of RAM and 2MB of Flash ROM.  

Video output of 512x384 VGA with 256-colors.  Supports 2 independent audio square-wave signals.  Input comes from 2x Genesis controllers, PS/2 Port with support for keyboard and mouse through splitter, and USB port with support for keyboard or mouse.  The USB port will also joystick/gamepad, flash drives, and can also be used to talk directly to a PC in device-mode.

Comes with attachment possibilities for an SPI Micro SDcard Adapter and a FT232RL USB-to-UART Adapter.  The PIC32 is programmed through ICSP port connecting to a PICkit3.

*** Board Edits: Exchange the 74HCT273 for a 74AHCT273 for faster timing responses and thus less jitter and bleeding. ***
